We look at the weird file and notice the first line contains an encoding hint

The `#coding: punycode` line is a special comment used to specify the character encoding of the Python source file. In this case, it's indicating that the file is encoded using Punycode.

### Solution

After checking with cyberchef `From Puny`, the encoding looks off.
After removing the first line of the code.

We can see the flag appearing in the code.

```
    if ᵢⁿᵖ == ('he2024{%s%s%s%s%s}' % (ᵖᵘⁿʸ.__ⁿᵃᵐᵉ__, '_', ᶜᵒᵈᵉ.__ⁿᵃᵐᵉ__, '_', ᶠᵘⁿ.__ⁿᵃᵐᵉ__)):
```

he2024{puny_code_fun}
