I found this suspicious door on an island during my last trip.

Can you find out where it is located?

### Solution
Again an OSINT challenge, first let us try to understand the text on top of the door.

Seems to be 
```
Erbaut 1983
Fa Ludwig Voss
Cuxhaven
```

After a long search through the Wadden Islands, I went back to the [[Red Door]] and saw that this was a radar tower.

After searching for radar tower Wattenmeer, I quickly found https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langl%C3%BCtjen

In other words, the flag is
