### Solution

This challenge is obviously steganography based.
Let us first check with the tool aperisolve and see if there is anything obvious going on.

The `zsteg` output does not really lead to anything.
We can see weird patterns in the following bit planes though at the top.

Red: 2

Green: 3

Blue: 4

Can help us extract the bit planes and we immediately get the flag
