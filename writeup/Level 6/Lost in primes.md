### Challenge description
One of our Prime eggs is lost.

It was last seen atÂ [factordb.com](http://factordb.com/).

The only thing we know is that it has not yet been proven that it is really prime, and has more than 27000 digits.

ðŸš© Flag

- slightly different flag prefix this time,Â `HE24`!
    
- format:Â `HE24{sample_flag}`

### Solution

- The leaked part looks like binary, so we can filter the primes based on that.
- FactorDB provides search endpoints
	- mindigits = 27000
	- not yet proven, so we should search on probably prime or unknown

The idea is to create a script which
- fetches numbers from 27000 digits onwards
- only U/PP
- Only keep 'binary' representations in decimal.

With the output, I would then assume binary -> UTF-8

#### Probably Prime?
After searching with the script in [[.src/6/lost_in_primes.py]]
I found the following candidate which looks a lot like the image.

If we enter the binary into the

We get the following image:

and the following flag
